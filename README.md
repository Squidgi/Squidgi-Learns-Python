# Squidgi-Learns-Python
My progress following the 100-day Python Challenge

Documenting my journey learning not just Python but Github and coding in general, mostly for my own entertainment and accountability. 
Please don't be mean, I know nothing.

It is 1 am and I am on day five of the python challenge. I have no idea what I'm doing. Editing the README file through github directly. Would like to investigate "committing" and "pulling", hopefully later today.
It's 'later today' and I think I got the push/pull thing config'd, now I just need to make the actual code for today's challenge functional xD
